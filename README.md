# Splasher

#### Operate splashes.txt on your own!

## Add an Translation

`May Change` Add a txt file named the same as your target language(etc. en_us.txt) under `.minecraft/config/splasher` and include your own translations.

If nothing is under the directory, Splasher will use the built-in splashes.txt from Minecraft.

## Apply an Translation

`May Change` For now, splashes.txt will be automatically translated into your client language(etc. client language "English(US)" equals to "en_us").
