#### Customize Minecraft Splash Texts on Your Own!

![icon](/artwork/banner.png)

## Contribute a Translation

Translate `assets/splasher/lang/en_us.json` into your favorite language and rename (`zh_cn.json` etc.), then create a pull request to contribute!

## Add a Customization

Add a `.txt` file named the same as your target language (`en_us.txt` etc.) under `.minecraft/config/splasher/customizations` and include your own customized splash texts (Every single splash takes a single line, `¬ß Formatting Code` is under supported).
These files on existence will be automatically added to the splashes if Minecraft client is under the correct language.

Note that none of the customizations will not be included in the mod. Players should create them on their own.
*If you are a modpack developer, everything goes on the same way.*

## Apply One of Them

For now, splashes.txt will be automatically translated into the mod's built-in `client language.json` file(etc. client language `English(US)` calls a translation from `en_us.json`). 
If no available translation for the target language is provided, `en_us.json` will be loaded.

You can always ignore the language files and unstick to the translations by an option.

Splasher has an option for players to choose to load either a customized `splashes.txt` (instead of translations) or the original splashes (with translations), or, if you want, to load both of them.
There is also an option to disable all splashes conveniently.

### Options in `.minecraft/config/splasher/config.json5`

#### `enable_festivals` decides whether to show festival splash texts or not, such as `Merry X-mas!` on Christmas and so on.

#### `disable_debug_info` decides whether to log debug info or not, such as current splash mode and splash text.

#### Options Graph of `splash_mode` and `follow_client_language`

**(Only works when `enable_splash_texts` is set to `true`)**
